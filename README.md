Theme: Evolution of digitalisation in the energy sector:
The energy sector is now in a profound transition towards a very important energy transformation, and digitalisation is one of the key facilitators to ensure that it is fulfilled. In the recent past, companies started by switching the use of analogue meters to digital meters, smart meters etc., in order to improve energy efficiency.
Digitalisation acts as a lever in the sector to combat climate change and optimise power generation processes to reduce emissions and meet the objective of decarbonisation of the energy model.

Main problems of the renewable energy sector : Impediments faced by companies in the sector are:
• Geographically dispersed energy data,
• Lack of integrated platform,
• Inability to track assets,
• Lack of clear and traceable objectives

Benefits of digital transformation in the renewable energy sector:
Digitalisation, if carried out guided by an integrated operations platform, facilitates the integration of renewable energies, energy policies and transparency in the management of these. In addition, it allows having the user much more connected, offering the following benefits:
• Digitalisation tools and platforms help build renewable energy plants with automated processes, for informed decision-making. In addition, the interconnections they propose are the basis for a more decentralised generation, thus avoiding isolated ‘energy islands’.
• These platforms reduce downtime by offering alerts based on predictive maintenance, anticipating asset maintenance. The modernisation of production plants is necessary to make them more competitive and efficient.
• They allow a more accurate forecast of the weather and market conditions, which helps to maximise renewable production, by offering a deep analysis of all information received in real time, to be able to make decisions and offer stability in demand.
• The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to optimise the engineering and construction of new renewable sources and plants reduces time to market, anticipating the benefits of free C02 generation and increasing production.

Objective: To develop Digital-based future energies
New power plants are born digital by their design, guaranteeing the efficiency and high availability of their services. In addition, they are backed by digital twins that help with modelling, forecasting, and testing for optimal performance, from power generation to its link with the customers.
However, for most existing plants, the basic need is in installing sensors and counters throughout the system to create Smart Grids. All these new systems must be connected to existing ones in order to achieve digitalisation in the sector.

Digitalisation: 
To achieve this, energy companies must rely on management software capable of interconnecting all assets and centralising their management in order to transition to renewable energy generation and reduce the carbon footprint in their operations

Target audiences:
• Private and Public Organisations, Homes, etc.
